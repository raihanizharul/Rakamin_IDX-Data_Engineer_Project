# Data Warehouse Project
  
One of the clients of ID/X Partners, operating in the banking industry, required the development of a Data Warehouse to integrate multiple data sources stored within their internal systems. The client manages data originating from several many sources including Excel files, CSV documents, and databases. The primary challenge faced by the client is the inability to extract and consolidate data from multiple sources simultaneously. This limitation leads to delayed reporting cycles and obstructs timely data analysis, which is critical for operations and decision-making within the banking environment.

This project focuses on building a robust Data Warehouse solution using the Medallion Architecture (Bronze–Silver–Gold layers). Additionally, the project implements stored procedures to generate Daily Transactions and Customer Balance outputs.
